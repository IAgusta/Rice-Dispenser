# RiceDropper

**RiceDropper** is an ESP32-based automatic rice dispenser that accepts user input via a keypad and allows configuration through a built-in webserver. It dispenses rice based on weight or price and logs total earnings and dropped weight.

## üåê Web Configuration

When powered on, RiceDropper creates a Wi-Fi Access Point:

- **SSID:** `RiceDropperAP`
- **Password:** `password123`

Connect and open `http://192.168.4.1` to:
- Change min quantity / price
- Set price per kg for Rice A and B
- Reset dropped weight and total earnings

All settings are stored in EEPROM.

## üìù Data Stored

- `pricePerKgA` / `pricePerKgB`
- `minPrice` / `minQuantity`
- `totalEarnings`
- `totalRiceDropped`
- `lastDropWeight` / `lastDropType`
- `calFactor`

All stored using EEPROM on the ESP32.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
3. Select the ESP32 board and correct COM port
4. Install required libraries:
   - `Keypad`
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
   - `ESP32Servo`
   - `WiFi`
   - `WebServer`
   - `EEPROM`
   - `HX711_ADC`
5. Upload and power your ESP32

## üß™ Notes

- Weight is rounded for transaction validation
- Prices are rounded to the nearest 500
- System uses a 60s timeout during dispensing
- Dispensing is blocked if minimums aren't met
- Buzzer will make a sound for 30 seconds when timeout (Rice runout)
